Helper module for loading your native module's bindings in a cross-platform way.\n\nThis is a helper module for authors of Node.js native addon modules. In node >=\n0.7.0, it is encouraged to statically precompile your native addons for your\nvarious supported platforms and architectures, rather than depend on your users\nto do that. This adds two new burdens on the developer that we now need to\nconsider while writing our module:\n\n 1. You now have to compile the bindings yourself, before publishing the module.\n 2. You now have to figure out which version of the bindings to load at runtime.\n\n`node-bindings` attempts to solve probelm `#2`.\n\nThis module solves the organizational problem of how to store these bindings\nfiles with a simple directory convention:\n\n```\n<module_root>/compiled/<node_version>/<platform>/<arch>/bindings.node\n```\n\nSo for example, on a 32-bit Windows platform, running node `v0.6.9`, the\n`bindings.node` file should be placed in:\n\n```\n<module_root>/compiled/0.6/win32/ia32/bindings.node\n```\n\nOn 64-bit Mac OS X, running node `v0.7.1`, then the bindings file should be\nplaced in:\n\n```\n<module_root>/compiled/0.7/darwin/x64/bindings.node\n```\n\nFor reference, the calculations for the various parts that makes up the require\npath are:\n\n * `<module_root>` - The directory where `package.json` is found is the root.\n * `<platform>` - `process.platform`\n * `<arch>` - `process.arch`\n * `<node_version>` - `parseFloat(process.versions.node)`\n\nThe default \"compiled\" directory is `compiled` and the default name of every\n\"bindings\" file is `bindings.node`. This is configurable if you'd like.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install bindings\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n`require()`ing the proper bindings file for the current node version, platform\nand architecture is as simple as:\n\n``` js\nvar bindings = require('bindings')()\n\n// Use your bindings defined in your C files\nbindings.your_c_function()\n```\n\nYou can specify the name of the bindings file if you desire:\n\n``` js\nvar bindings = require('bindings')('my_bindings')\n```\n\nOr you can pass in an options Object for full configuration:\n\n\n``` js\nvar bindings = require('bindings')({\n    bindings: 'my_bindings'\n  , compiled: 'builddir'\n})\n```\n\nNice Error Output\n-----------------\n\n```\nError: Could not load the bindings file.

To make matters worse, now the _gyp_ build tool can\nproduce either a _Release_ or _Debug_ build, each being built into different\nlocations.\n\nThis module checks _all_ the possible locations that a native addon would be built\nat, and returns the first one that loads successfully.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install bindings\n```\n\nOr add it to the `\"dependencies\"` section of your _package.json_ file.\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n`require()`ing the proper bindings file for the current node version, platform\nand architecture is as simple as:\n\n``` js\nvar bindings = require('bindings')('binding.node')\n\n// Use your bindings defined in your C files\nbindings.your_c_function()\n```\n\n\nNice Error Output\n-----------------\n\nWhen the `.node` file could not be loaded, `node-bindings` throws an Error with\na nice error message telling you exactly what was tried. You can also check the\n`err.tries` Array property.\n\n```\nError: Could not load the bindings file.

In node >=\n0.7.0, it is encouraged to statically precompile your native addons for your\nvarious supported platforms and architectures, rather than depend on your users\nto do that. This adds an additional burden on the developer since we now have to\ncompile the bindings ourselves, before publishing the module. We also have to\nfigure out which version of the bindings to load at runtime, and that's where\n`node-bindings` comes into play.\n\nThis module solves the organizational problem of how to store these bindings files\nwith a simple directory convention:\n\n```\n<module root>/compiled/<platform>/<arch>/<node_version>/bindings.node\n```\n\nSo for example, on a 32-bit Windows platform, running node `v0.6.9`, the\n`bindings.node` file should be placed in:\n\n```\n<module root>/compiled/win32/ia32/0.6/bindings.node\n```\n\nOn 64-bit Mac OS X, running node `v0.7.1-pre`, then the bindings file should be\nplaced in:\n\n```\n<module root>/compiled/darwin/x64/0.7/bindings.node\n```\n\nFor reference, the calculations for the various parts that makes up the require\npath are:\n\n * `<module_root>` - The directory where `package.json` is found is the root.\n * `<platform>` - `process.platform`\n * `<arch>` - `process.arch`\n * `<node_version>` - `parseFloat(process.versions.node)`\n\n The default \"compiled\" directory is `compiled` and the default name of every\n bindings file is `bindings.node`. This is configurable if you'd like.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install bindings\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n`require()`ing the proper bindings file for the given platform and architecture\nand node version is as simple as:\n\n``` js\nvar bindings = require('bindings')()\n\n// Use your bindings defined in your C files\nbindings.your_c_function()\n```\n\nYou can specify the name of the bindings file if you desire:\n\n``` js\nvar bindings = require('bindings')('my_bindings.node')\n```\n\nOr you can pass in an options Object for full configuration:\n\n\n``` js\nvar bindings = require('bindings')({\n    bindings: 'my_bindings.node'\n  , compiled: 'builddir'\n})\n```\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"TooTallNate","email":"nathan@tootallnate.net"},{"name":"tootallnate","email":"nathan@tootallnate.net"}],"time":{"modified":"2013-09-08T20:31:40.458Z","created":"2012-01-28T22:29:53.409Z","0.0.1":"2012-01-28T22:29:54.674Z","0.1.0":"2012-01-30T05:21:01.149Z","0.1.1":"2012-02-04T00:12:39.290Z","0.2.0":"2012-02-07T01:33:09.621Z","0.2.1":"2012-02-07T02:38:46.274Z","0.2.2":"2012-02-12T01:46:40.563Z","0.2.3":"2012-02-14T17:28:06.105Z","0.2.4":"2012-02-15T18:40:22.228Z","0.3.0":"2012-02-28T19:39:05.034Z","0.4.0":"2012-06-25T18:40:06.605Z","1.0.0":"2012-07-18T18:49:12.866Z","1.1.0":"2013-03-07T09:16:27.293Z","1.1.1":"2013-07-11T05:05:03.115Z"},"author":{"name":"Nathan Rajlich","email":"nathan@tootallnate.net","url":"http://tootallnate.net"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/TooTallNate/node-bindings.git"},"users":{"fgribreau":true,"werle":true,"tootallnate":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"6HKBZIWXK5GSWCYYR9XFSNAIR\""}
